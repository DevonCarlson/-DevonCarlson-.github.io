<h1>Essay</h1>
<p>In case you were not aware, polar bears are incredibly beautiful creatures. Entirely unique in their appearance, there are no other animals quite like them. Weighing in at around 772 to 1,543 lb they are very large creatures, who through evolution have been designed to withstand the incredibly low temperatures that they face in their habitats. The polar bear mostly resides in the Arctic Circle, the Arctic Ocean, the Arctic Ocean’s neighbouring seas, as well as the surrounding land masses. There is a very common theme amongst these places, and that is that</p>
<h2>Polar bears love the cold.</h2>
<p>Similar to other mammals at the top of their respective food chains, polar bears have a very low reproductive rate. Polar bears only tend to give birth to one or two cubs every three years or so and even then, polar bears don’t begin to reproduce until they are at least five or six years old. Once polar bear cubs are ready to leave the den, their mother will take them out to floating sea ice in order to teach them how to hunt seals. These seals (and therefor the floating ice that they come up onto) are absolutely critical for the viability of polar bears as a species. These seals that they hunt provide the mama polar bears and their cubs with sufficient fat to survive seasons when seals are not readily available. When polar bears find themselves in these seasons they are faced with long periods of fasting, and fewer and smaller baby cubs.</p>			
<p>Photos have recently surfaced of shockingly skinny polar bears that are clearly being deprived of food, and they are quite hard to look at. It’s really quite tragic. This, coupled with the fact that polar bear populations are on the decline is incredibly concerning. In a study conducted in 2016 by Trent University it was reported that polar bear populations have declined by nearly a fifth compared to an original study in 2011 (Trent University). That’s a 17% drop in only five years, which I believe ro be a huge cause for concern. The point that I would like to illustrate here is that polar bear populations are extremely sensitive to change, and as they require a very particular set of circumstances to thrive and flourish as a species. With polar bear populations on the decline, this is beginning to put them in an incredibly vulnerable position. Photos have recently surfaced of shockingly skinny polar bears that are clearly being deprived of food, and they are quite hard to look at.</p>

<p>In many languages polar bears are suitably referred to as “ice bears”, as ice is such a key component and factor in a polar bear’s livelihood. Unfortunately, these patches of sea ice are disappearing. According to a study published in the Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics journal, arctic ice is beginning to melt nearly nice as fast at it should be, due largely in part to rising Co2 levels that humans have been polluting our atmosphere with (Hansen). These changes are largely causing this tragic influx of bears, as the Russian brand of the World Wildlife Fund claims blames climate change for the drastic change in bear populations, as smaller ice caps means less opportunity for polar bears to hunt seals for food (World Wildlife Fund). This in turn is</p>
<h2>causing polar bears to search elsewhere for food</h2>

<p>The northern Russian town of Belushya Guba, also known as Sturgeon Bay, is a military community of just over 2000 people. This past week the city’s declared a state of emergency, as several dozen polar bear families have made their way into the town, making themselves at home. The bears have been seen digging through dumpsters and investigating people’s homes, scavenging for food. The city has declared this as a full blown occupation, and is currently at a loss as to what they can do to deal with this problem.
</p>

<p>This begs the question: What can be done to stop this? As various human activities have often had detrimental effects on other animal species, we’ve often times tired various conversation efforts to reverse these effects. Sometimes successfully, other times unsuccessfully (Indiana University). One of the biggest impacts that we can make it to reduce our carbon footprint, and in turn make an effort to emit way less C02 into the Earth’s atmosphere. A great number of people seem to drive their own personal gas powered vehicles to work everyday while many of them could easily take public transit instead, residing their impact on the atmosphere. The United States Environmental Protection Agency claims that “A typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year” (EPA). They also go on to state that “a typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year” (EPA). This is staggering when you consider the sheer amount of cars you see on the road on any given day. Instead of driving to work everyday, why not consider taking public transit? Doing so can even have several additional benefits such as saving individuals money wasted on gasoline and parking. When the weather is nice during the summer, why not ride a bike? Biking to work every day has even reportedly saved individuals thousands of dollars a year (CNBC). </p>

<p>Greener forms of transportation are becoming more and more viable, as innovative new options to move from place to place are becoming much more commonplace. The new baseline price of the Tesla Model 3 electric car is only thirty five thousand dollars, which is quite affordable all things considered. It has an EPA-rated milage of 220 miles on a single charge, making it more than capable of replacing most traditional vehicles or personal transport. Telsa has even begun the development and production of what they are calling Solar Roof, seamlessly-traditional looking roof panels that actually work as fully functioning solar panels. These are being developed as a means to eventually replace traditional means of powering one’s home, leading to net-zero solar electricity and the drastically reduced carbon footprint of households.</p>

<p>On top of rethinking how you commute, there are numerous other ways one can help save the polar bears by reducing their carbon footprint. According to a series of studies conducted by the United Nations University, the simple most significant way one can reduce their carbon footprint is by reducing or eliminating farmed meat from their diets (Carrington). According to the United Nations University “Emissions from livestock, largely from burping cows and sheep and their manure, currently make up almost 15% of global emissions. Beef and dairy alone make up 65% of all livestock emissions” (UNU). Not only could reducing consumption be good for your health, but it can also be good for the livelihood of polar bears.</p>

<p>One of the most tragic things about humanity as a whole is that by nature, it seems like we care a generally selfish species. Most of us know that our actions are causing detrimental effects on the planet, but many of us are resistant or stubborn to change. It seems like many of us put our own desires above caring for the collective good of our planet, and this is bad news for polar bears. If serious actions are not done soon, there very well might be a future in which polar bears no longer exisits. It would be a shame for such a beautiful species to go the way of the dodo, to no fault of their own. Hopefully we find a way to reverse the direction that climate change is taking, or else this soon might be the case.</p>
