    <p>Zeplin is a software that allows you to convert your Sketch design files into CSS and HTML code, helping to bridge the gap between a teams designers and programmers. What I really enjoy about Zeplin’s website is it’s clean graphics and simple straightforward page layout. With a clear call to action and obvious portrayal of information. My favourite part of Zeplin’s website are the illustrated vegetables on it’s pricing page, as well as their tastefully subtle emoji usage. </p>
