    <p>After winning numerous website design awards, Wealthsimple’s new website is by far one of the most well crafted website’s I’ve ever seen in my life. Many websites will guide you through a single file on-rails experience, but Wealthsimple’s website keeps users compelled to continue scrolling, as you want to see where the beautifully animated rolling coin ends up.</p>
