                <h1>In case you were not aware,</h1>
                <p> polar bears are incredibly beautiful creatures. Entirely unique in their appearance, 
                    there are no other animals quite like them. Weighing in at around 772 to 1,543 lb they 
                    are very large creatures, who through evolution have been designed to withstand the 
                    incredibly low temperatures that they face in their habitats (Carl). The polar bear 
                    mostly resides in the Arctic Circle, the Arctic Ocean, the Arctic Ocean’s neighboring 
                    seas, as well as the surrounding land masses (Carl). There is a very common theme 
                    amongst these places, and that is...</p>

                <h1>that polar bears love the cold.</h1>
                <p>Similar to other mammals at the top of their respective food chains, polar 
                        bears have a very low reproductive rate. Polar bears only tend to give birth 
                        to one or two cubs every three years or so and even then, polar bears don’t 
                        begin to reproduce until they are at least five or six years old (WWF). Once 
                        polar bear cubs are ready to leave the den, their mother will take them out to 
                        floating sea ice in order to teach them how to hunt seals. These seals (and 
                        therefore the floating ice that they come up onto) are absolutely critical for the 
                        viability of polar bears as a species (WWF). These seals that they hunt provide the 
                        mama polar bears and their cubs with sufficient fat to survive seasons when seals 
                        are not readily available. When polar bears find themselves in these seasons they are 
                        faced with long periods of fasting, and fewer and smaller baby cubs (Sterling).

                <h1>Photos have recently surfaced</h1>
                <p>of shockingly skinny polar bears that are clearly being deprived of food, 
                            and they are quite hard to look at. It’s really quite tragic (CBC). This, 
                            coupled with the fact that polar bear populations are on the decline is 
                            incredibly concerning. In a study conducted in 2016 by Trent University, 
                            it was reported that polar bear populations have declined by nearly a fifth 
                            compared to an original study in 2011 (Trent University). That’s a 17% drop 
                            in only five years, which I believe to be a huge cause for concern. The point 
                            that I would like to illustrate here is that polar bear populations are 
                            extremely sensitive to change, and they require a very particular set of 
                            circumstances to thrive and flourish as a species. With polar bear populations 
                            on the decline, this is beginning to put them in an incredibly vulnerable 
                            position.

                <h1>In many languages</h1>
                <p>polar bears are suitably referred to as “ice bears”, as ice is such a key 
                                component and factor in a polar bear’s livelihood (WWF). Unfortunately, 
                                these patches of sea ice are disappearing (Hansen). According to a study 
                                published in the Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics journal, arctic ice is 
                                beginning to melt nearly twice as fast at it should be, due largely in part 
                                to rising Co2 levels that humans have been polluting our atmosphere with 
                                (NASA). These changes are largely causing this tragic influx of bears, as 
                                the Russian branch of the World Wildlife Fund claims blames climate change 
                                for the drastic change in bear populations, as smaller ice caps means less 
                                opportunity for polar bears to hunt seals for food (WWF). This in turn is...

                    <p>The northern Russian town of Belushya Guba, also known as 
                        Sturgeon Bay, is a military community of just over 2000 people. 
                        This past week the city’s declared a state of emergency, as several 
                        dozen polar bear families have made their way into the town, making 
                        themselves at home. The bears have been seen digging through dumpsters 
                        and investigating people’s homes, scavenging for food (Brown). The 
                        city has declared this as a full-blown occupation and is currently at a 
                        loss as to what they can do to deal with this problem.</p>

                    <h1>This begs the question:</h1>
                        <p>What can be done to stop this? As various human activities have 
                            had detrimental effects on other animal species, we’ve often times 
                            tired various conversation efforts to reverse these effects. Sometimes 
                            successfully, other times unsuccessfully (Indiana University). One of the 
                            biggest impacts that we can make it reduce our carbon footprint, and in 
                            turn make an effort to emit way less C02 into the Earth’s atmosphere. A 
                            great number of people seem to drive their own personal gas-powered vehicles 
                            to work every day while many of them could easily take public transit instead, 
                            residing their impact on the atmosphere. The United States Environmental 
                            Protection Agency claims that “A typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 
                            metric tons of carbon dioxide per year” (EPA). This is staggering when you 
                            consider the sheer amount of cars you see on the road on any given day. 
                            Instead of driving to work every day, why not consider taking public transit? 
                            Doing so can even have several additional benefits such as saving individuals 
                            money wasted on gasoline and parking. When the weather is nice during the summer, 
                            why not ride a bike? Biking to work every day has even reportedly saved individuals 
                            thousands of dollars a year (CNBC).</p>

                            <p>are becoming more and more viable, as innovative new options 
                                to move from place to place are becoming much more commonplace. 
                                The new baseline price of the Tesla Model 3 electric car is only 
                                thirty-five thousand dollars, which is quite affordable all things 
                                considered. It has an EPA-rated mileage of 220 miles on a single 
                                charge, making it more than capable of replacing most traditional 
                                vehicles or personal transport (Sendy). Telsa has even begun the development 
                                and production of what they are calling Solar Roof, seamlessly-traditional 
                                looking roof panels that actually work as fully functioning solar panels. 
                                These are being developed as a means to eventually replace traditional means

                                <p>one can help save the polar bears by reducing 
                                    their carbon footprint. According to a series of 
                                    studies conducted by the United Nations University, 
                                    the simple most significant way one can reduce their 
                                    carbon footprint is by reducing or eliminating farmed meat 
                                    from their diets (Carrington). According to the United Nations
                                     University “Emissions from livestock, largely from burping cows
                                      and sheep and their manure, currently, make up almost 15% of 
                                      global emissions. Beef and dairy alone make up 65% of all livestock

                                       for your health, but it can also be good for the livelihood of

                                    <p>about humanity as a whole is that by nature, it seems like 
                                        we are a generally selfish species. Most of us know that our 
                                        actions are causing detrimental effects on the planet, but many
                                         of us are resistant or stubborn to change. It seems like many
                                          of us put our own desires above caring for the collective good 
                                          of our planet, and this is bad news for polar bears. If serious 
                                          actions are not taken soon, we very well might live a future in
                                           which polar bears no longer exists. It would be a shame for 
                                           such a beautiful species to go the way of the dodo, to no fault 
                                           of their own. Hopefully, we find a way to reverse the direction
                                            that climate change is taking, or else this soon might be the
                                            case.
