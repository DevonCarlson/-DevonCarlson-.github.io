    <p>I feel like as with many sites are reasons to love GQ.com and reasons to hate GQ.com. Some of the things that I love about GQ are that it’s playfully colourful, and that the majority of the screen realestate is dedicated to well composted photos and carefully curated product images. I love their choice of typeface, and I feel like GQ.com is an embodiment of a fashion magazine come to life. What I don’t like about GQ is that they’ve fallen into the trend of placing a banner ad at the top of their site right below the nav bar, which completely breaks the seamlessness of the experience. That, and the screen covering pop-up prompts that ask for my email that are almost never welcome.</p>
