            <p>The Arctic Circle is one of the most northern places found on Earth’s map. The Arctic Circle is home to approximately 2 million humans, as well as approximately 25 thousand polar bears. The Arctic Circle is prone to “Polar Nights” and “Polar Days” where the sun will remain completely visible or completely invisible for periods of 24 continuous hours, a phenomenon completely unique to this area. This portion of the earth is incredibly cold, with average temperatures ranging anywhere from −34 °C to downwards of −50 °C.</p>
