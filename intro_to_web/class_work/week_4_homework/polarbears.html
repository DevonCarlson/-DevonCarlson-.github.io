        <p>The polar bear is a mammal who primarily lives in the Arctic Circle, along with it’s surrounding seas and land masses. Weighing in at around 772 to 1,543 lb they are very large creatures, who through evolution have been designed to withstand the incredibly low temperatures that they face in their habitats. Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice, often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present. Because of their dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are classified as marine mammals.</p>
