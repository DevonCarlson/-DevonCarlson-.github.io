            <p>Climate change is an incredibly dangerous threat to both planet earth and all of its inhabitants. From the burning of fossil fuels to the abuse of non-reusable materials, to the overconsumption of farmed meat; the inherently selfish nature of humanity seems to be leading to the end of the world. According to NASA, carbon dioxide levels in the Earth’s atmosphere have begun to reach an all time high, leaving our planet’s protective ozone layer dangerously thin. This has resulted in a global heating of sorts, that is beginning to melt the Arctic Circle and pose huge risks to its polar bear populations. It’s been reported that the Earth’s polar bear population is set to dwindle down to a third of what it used to be, thanks to the selfishness of the human race. Something must be done to save the polar bears, as well as to save humanity itself.</p>
