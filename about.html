                <h1>Brand development</h1>
                <p>it starts with a name. the face of your 
                company, and the way the world perceives 
                you. <br><br>

                Itâ€™s more than just a logo and 
                typeset, my goal is to help your 
                team develop a laserfocused branding strategy that is so on-point you 
                could poke yourself on it. <br><br>
                                
                (my copywritting is much 
                better than that). Along with 
                all of the essentials that make up 
                a world class brand, Iâ€™ll supply 
                your team with all the 
                Illustrations, icons and supporting elements 
                that youâ€™ll need to make a lasting impression on the world.

                        <h1>Web design</h1>
                        <p>Having a well-crafted website that stands out above the rest has never been more important. 
                                        Thatâ€™s why I coded this website by hand.<br><br>
        
                                        Rather than falling prey to trendy gimmicks, itâ€™s crucial to have responsive designs that are built to last. Aretfully crafted pages and world-class animation goes a long way in separating you from the rest, and thatâ€™s exactly what youâ€™ll get from me. Nothing half-assed <br><br>

                                <p>Not to toot my own horn, but I developed and sold my first iPhone app at 14 years old. Iâ€™ve spent the better half of my life working with different user experiences, weather they exist in the form of a companyâ€™s SAS platform or the way they onboard new employees. <br><br>
                
                                        Iâ€™ve helped a wide variety of companies perfect their userâ€™s experiences, leading to quantitative leaps in their user stats<br><br>
